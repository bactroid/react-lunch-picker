## react-lunch-picker

React version of lunch picker front-end.

This app is mostly a React/Redux demo for my team.

## Repo Contents

The master branch contains an extremely simple front-end to a web API built to power a Slack slash command. Master branch uses React, Redux, Redux-Promise, and the pieces necessary to tie them together.

The saga branch contains exactly the same app with the Redux middleware changed out, replacing Redux-Promise with Redux-Saga.

The interface for both apps uses Material-UI.

## Installation

Clone this repo and thenâ€¦

```
npm install
npm start
```

The page should load in your browser automatically.
